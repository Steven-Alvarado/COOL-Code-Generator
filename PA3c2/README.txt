My code generator is currently not producing correct outputs for the operational
semantics of Cool. I have managed to generate correct code for 33/41 of PA3C3 
test cases but failed to implement all operational semantics and optimize my code 
generator with in the alotted time. This is very disappointing for me, but I feel that
regardless of this failure I leaned a lot more then I every would have known 
about compiler internals and how these systems are designed and built. My approach to
the code generator hindered my ability to finish due to my own poor foresight handling 
internal data types and objects as well as dispatch and SELF_TYPE. I look forward to 
attempting to finish this over the summer and learning how to correct and improve my 
current implementation.
